How it works
------------
It fetches the original RSS-Feed and adds <enclosure> tags to the new build 
Feed. The "url" attributes are directly from JSON files generated by the 
original website. The Programm is a rewrite in Java from a little perl 
script i wrote, to support Google App Engine. 


Current status
--------------
Still just a prototype, error handling is bad. At performace let 
lots of room for efficiency improvements.
